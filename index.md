## Problem Definition
  For our project we decided to create a computer vision program that is capable of "playing" the game pick-up sticks.  In the game of pick-up sticks, players take turns trying to remove sticks from a random pile without disturbing the other sticks.  During their turn, a player can continue to pick up individual sticks until they either cause a disturbance or deplete the pile.  With this in mind, we focused on designing a program capable of describing an optimal order in which to continuously pick up sticks without disturbing other sticks.  To help maintain a reasonable scope for the project we decided to ignore the point system and advanced rules of pick-up sticks.  We also required that each stick be a unique color, which also ended up limiting the max number of sticks we could include in our test images.  This gave as a simple, clearly defined goal for the project; given an image of a simple pile of sticks, describe a best order in which to pick them up.

## Motivation

  At its core this problem encompasses fundamentals of computer vision such as edge detection and object identification while also providing a simple foundation for exploring more complex topics as time allows.  As an example, we might improve our program’s design by adding some form of consideration for the physics that govern one stick’s behavior when another stick is removed.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mlk-713/cs766_project/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mlk-713/cs766_project/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
